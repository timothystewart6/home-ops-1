## üìñ Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using the tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## ‚õµ Kubernetes

There's an excellent template over at [k8s-at-home/template-cluster-k3](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/template-cluster-k3s) if you wanted to try and follow along with some of the practices I use here.

### Installation

My cluster is [k3s](https://k3s.io/) provisioned overtop bare-metal Ubuntu 20.04 using the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) galaxy role [ansible-role-k3s](https://github.com/PyratLabs/ansible-role-k3s). This is a semi hyper-converged cluster, workloads and block storage are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a separate server for (NFS) file storage.

üî∏ _[Click here](./ansible/) to see my Ansible playbooks and roles._

### Core Components

- [projectcalico/calico](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico): Internal Kubernetes networking plugin.
- [rook/rook](https://github.com/rook/rook): Distributed block storage for peristent storage.
- [mozilla/sops](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): Manages secrets for Kubernetes, Ansible and Terraform.
- [kubernetes-sigs/external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically manages DNS records from my cluster in a cloud DNS provider.
- [jetstack/cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): Creates SSL certificates for services in my Kubernetes cluster.
- [kubernetes/ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/): Ingress controller to expose HTTP traffic to pods over DNS.

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [cluster](./cluster/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my cluster based on the YAML manifests.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories (_kustomizatons_) under [cluster](./cluster/).

```sh
üìÅ cluster      # k8s cluster defined as code
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ base       # flux, gitops operator, loaded before everything
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ crds       # custom resources, loaded before üìÅ core and üìÅ apps
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ charts     # helm repos, loaded before üìÅ core and üìÅ apps
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ config     # cluster config, loaded before üìÅ core and üìÅ apps
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ core       # crucial apps, namespaced dir tree, loaded before üìÅ apps
‚îî‚îÄüìÅ apps       # regular apps, namespaced dir tree, loaded last
```

### Networking

| Name                                         | CIDR              |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Kubernetes Nodes                             | `192.168.42.0/24` |
| Kubernetes external services (Calico w/ BGP) | `192.168.69.0/24` |
| Kubernetes pods                              | `10.69.0.0/16`    |
| Kubernetes services                          | `10.96.0.0/16`    |

- HAProxy configured on Opnsense for the Kubernetes Control Plane Load Balancer.
- Calico configured with `externalIPs` to expose Kubernetes services with their own IP over BGP which is configured on my router.

### Persistent Volume Data Backup and Recovery

This is a hard topic to explain because there isn't a single great tool to work with rook-ceph. There's [Velero](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero), [Benji](https://github.com/elemental-lf/benji), [Gemini](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/gemini), and others but they all have different amount of issues or nuances which makes them unsable for me.

Currently I am leveraging [Kasten K10 by Veeam](https://www.kasten.io/product/) which does a good job of snapshotting Ceph block volumes and the exports the data in the snapshot to durable storage (S3 / NFS).

## üåê DNS

### Ingress Controller

Over WAN, I have port forwarded ports `80` and `443` to the load balancer IP of my ingress controller that's running in my Kubernetes cluster.

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) works as a proxy to hide my homes WAN IP and also as a firewall. When not on my home network, all the traffic coming into my ingress controller on port `80` and `443` comes from Cloudflare. In `Opnsense` I block all IPs not originating from the [Cloudflares list of IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/).

üî∏ _Cloudflare is also configured to GeoIP block all countries except a few I have whitelisted_

### Internal DNS

[k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway) is deployed on `Opnsense`. With this setup, `k8s_gateway` has direct access to my clusters ingress records and serves DNS for them in my internal network. `k8s_gateway` is only listening on `127.0.0.1` on port `53`.

For adblocking, I have [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome) also deployed on `Opnsense` which has a upstream server pointing the `k8s_gateway` I mentioned above. `Adguard Home` listens on my `MANAGEMENT`, `SERVER`, `IOT` and `GUEST` networks on port `53`. In my firewall rules I have NAT port redirection forcing all the networks to use the `Adguard Home` DNS server.

Without much engineering of DNS @home, these options have made my `Opnsense` router a single point of failure for DNS. I believe this is ok though because my router _should_ have the most uptime of all my systems.

### External DNS

[external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) is deployed in my cluster and configure to sync DNS records to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). The only ingresses `external-dns` looks at to gather DNS records to put in `Cloudflare` are ones that I explicitly set an annotation of `external-dns/is-public: "true"`

üî∏ _[Click here](./terraform/cloudflare) to see how else I manage Cloudflare with Terraform._

### Dynamic DNS

My home IP can change at any given time and in order to keep my WAN IP address up to date on Cloudflare. I have deployed a [CronJob](./cluster/apps/networking/cloudflare-ddns) in my cluster, this periodically checks and updates the `A` record `ipv4.domain.tld`.
